TODO LIST:    -*- mode: org -*-

* DONE Implement conceptual tree
* TODO Register new namespace for conceptual tree
   Proposal: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netmod:tree:1
* DONE Implement handling of RPCs
  For every rpc, create a <nmt:rpc> under <nmt:rpcs>.
* DONE Implement handling of notifications
  For every notification, create a <nmt:notification> under
  <nmt:notification>.
* TODO Implement unique and keyref via Schematron abstract patterns.
  Should these patterns be included in the RNG schema as annotations?
  Probably not, it will only appear in the stand-alone Schematron
  schema.
* TODO Implement validation phases
  Schematron phases seem to be good for this purpose. The disadvantage
  is that it can be used only for Schematron, so perhaps only two
  phases can be implemented this way - full and partial (references
  needn't be valid) 
* DONE Implement handling of "extension"
  Just put it to the schema (in YIN form). This could be optional -
  via command-line args or config file.
* DONE Implement refinements in "uses"
  The content of the grouping should be expanded in place and the
  refinements added.
* DONE Implement "augment"
  Should be similar to refinements (it's a pity that the syntax
  differs). Augments have to be always handled last among the siblings
  so that the stuff to be augmented is already present in the ETree.
  Top-level augments that modify foreign modules will be ignored.
* XSLT stylesheets
** DONE RELAX NG
** TODO Schematron
** TODO DSRL
* Other programs
** get/get-config schema reflecting a specific filter
   This cannot probably be implemented in XSLT but might be
   interesting.
