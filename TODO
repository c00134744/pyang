  o  handle core yang stmts in extesions

  o  add validation of XPath (lower prio) (when, must)

  o  add more stuff to XSD output:
     o  generate xs:unique for 'unique'

  o  handle relative inline augment

  o  add validation of instance-identifier defaults

  o  rewrite .validate to be side-effect free

  o  better handling of multiple input files

  o  better handling of filename vs. modulename.  either enforce a

  o  send entire text file contents to the parse functions
