Code structure
--------------
bin/pyang
  The executable script documented in pyang(1).

pyang/
  Contains the pyang library code.

pyang/__init__.py
  Initalization code for the pyang library.
  Defines the Context and Repository clasess.

pyang/syntax.py
  Generic syntax checking for YANG and YIN statements.
  Defines regular expressions for argument checking of core
  statements.

pyang/grammar.py
  Generic grammar for YANG and YIN.
  Defines chk_module_statements() which validates a parse tree
  according to the grammar.

pyang/statements.py
  Defines the generic Statement class, and special classes for each
  YANG statement.  Also contains all validation code.
  This code will be rewritten - all specialized classes will be
  removed, and the validation code driven by a map instead.
